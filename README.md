\# Resume Analyzer by Avishkar 🚀



This is a small AI project I built to practice Python and regex.  

It checks a resume for important keywords like Python, SQL, Machine Learning, etc.,  

and tells me which ones are missing.



\### Example

Input Resume:

"I am Avishkar, B.Sc. IT student. Skilled in Python, SQL, Data Analysis."



Output:

✅ Found: Python, SQL, Data Analysis  

❌ Missing: Machine Learning, Communication, Teamwork, Java

I plan to extend this project to read resumes directly from PDF files and rank candidates.
